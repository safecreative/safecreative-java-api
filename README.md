## What is Safe Creative
[Safe Creative](http://www.safecreative.org) is the first independent on-line world wide copyright registry, free to use, open to all and globally accessible. The service allows creators and rightholders to register their works and obtain a valid proof suitable to be used on trial, by means of a certificate of registry digitally signed. As a difference between Safe Creative and other registries, works may be registered indicating the rights concerning them, supporting the most common licenses rights of their choice. It is independent from the various models of license rights available to creators for the protection or sharing of their works: traditional copyright, Creative Commons, GPL, etc.
